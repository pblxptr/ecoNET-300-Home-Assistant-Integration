## Overview
ecoNET300 Home Assistant is a custom integration for ecoNET300 devices. 

It works locally, which means it connects directly to your local device using local IP address. It doesn't forward commands/requests through econet24.com. It uses rest api exposed by ecoNET300 device.

This integration is available from the Lovelace frontend without the need to configure the devices in the file configuration.yaml

**Bear in mind that the project is in a very early, pre-alpha phase.**

Plans for first relase:
- support for some of readonly properties (like mixer temp, ext sensor temp)

## Contribution

I work on this project only in my very-limited free time. At this moment I have opened a few other projects which are on a bit higher priority than this one, but I'm going to work on this quite regularlly as I use it in my home automation. However, if you want to help and contribute to this project **it will be highly appreciated.**

Also if you see a need for a particular feature, don't hesitate to let me know.
